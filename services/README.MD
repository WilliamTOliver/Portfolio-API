## Services
This is the home of python service files executed through PythonShell.
These are only functional when run in a local python environment set up to handle the dependancies required in the service files. The deployment plan for the API does not take into consideration running Python on the server, and rather handles the data created by these more or less static services by way of stored values in the mongo db.
